Hi! I'm Howard. Welcome to my corner of the internet, my second brain. Here you will find snippets of what goes on in my mind and what I'm up to IRL.

Currently, my primary passion is the exploration of what it takes to build a better web at the intersection of web3 and privacy technologies. By day, I engineer cryptographic protocols for decentralized key management infrastructure at [Lit Protocol](https://www.litprotocol.com/). By night, you will find me either learning or indulging in my several other passion projects. ü§òüèª

I also love teaching and bringing fresh talent into the technology industry, especially the niche that I am in, so I mentor on the side - [check me out](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/howardtam/)!
