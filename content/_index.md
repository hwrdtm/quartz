Hi! I'm Howard. Welcome to my corner of the internet, my second brain. Here you will find snippets of what goes on in my mind and what I'm up to IRL.

Currently, my primary passion is the exploration of what it takes to build a better web at the intersection of web3 and privacy technologies. By day, I am helping [Lit Protocol](https://www.litprotocol.com/) launch a decentralized key management infrastructure. By night, you will find me either learning or indulging in my several other passion projects. Once a tinkerer, always a tinkerer. ü§òüèª

I also love teaching and bringing fresh talent into the technology industry, especially the niche that I am in, so I also mentor on the side - [check me out](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/howardtam/)!
