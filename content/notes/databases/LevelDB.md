title: LevelDB
---
LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.

LevelDB is used as the backend database for Google Chrome's IndexedDBÂ and is one of the supported backends for Riak.

One reason why LevelDB is fast is because it utilizes the LSM tree.
