# Definition

A generic G-DSA signature algorithm is defined as follows:
- The public parameters include a cyclic group $G$ of prime order $q$ generated by an element $g$, a hash function $H : \{ 0,1 \}^{*} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{q}$ defined from arbitrary strings into $\mathbb{Z}_{q}$  and another hash function $H' : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{q}$ defined from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{q}$.
- Key-Gen: On input the security parameter $\lambda$,
	- outputs a private key $x$ chosen uniformly at random in $\mathbb{Z}_{q}$, and
	- a public key $y = g^{x}$ computed in $G$.
- Signature: On input an arbitrary message $M$,
	- compute $m = H(M) \in \mathbb{Z}_{q}$
	- choose $k \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}$ 
	- compute $R = g^{k^{-1}}$ in $G$ and $r = H'(R) \in \mathbb{Z}_{q}$
	- compute $s = k(m +xr) \bmod q$
	- output $\sigma = (r,s)$
- Verification: On input $M$, $\sigma$ and $y$,
	- check that $r,s \in \mathbb{Z}_{q}$
	- compute $R' = g^{ms^{-1} \bmod q} y^{rs^{-1} \bmod q}$ in $G$.
	- accept (outupt 1) iff $H'(R') = r$.

The traditional DSA algorithm is obtained by:
- choosing large primes $p,q$ such that $q|(p-1)$ and setting $G$ to be the subgroup $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$ of order $q$
- in this case the multiplication operation in $G$ is multiplication modulo $p$.
- the function $H'$ is defined as $H'(R) = R \bmod q$.

The EC-DSA algorithm is obtained by:
- choosing $G$ as a group of points on an elliptic curve of cardinality $q$. 
- in this case the multiplication operation in $G$ is the group operation over the curve.
- the function $H'$ is defined as $H'(R) = R_{x} \bmod q$ where $R_{x}$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point $R$. 

# Threshold DSA

The main technical issue in constructing threshold DSA signatures is dealing with the fact that _both_ the secret key $x$ and the nonce $k$ have to remain secret. This means that in a threshold scheme, they must be shared in some way among the servers.
