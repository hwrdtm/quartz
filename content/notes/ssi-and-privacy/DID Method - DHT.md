title: DID Method - DHT
---
`did:dht` is a DID method (currently still a Working Draft) that uses Pkarr to store DID documents in BitTorrent's Mainline DHT. Storing information this way ensures that identity information is maintained in a decentralized manner.

This DID method can be created, updated, read, and deactivated.
